# Add touch events

Now lets add touch events. While not always necessary since the
experience is primarily voice first, touch events allow hybrid
interactions between the customer and Alexa.

1.  For this bit, we are going to update our Launch Request screen to
    accept touch input. We are already sending a dynamic databound
    argument so let’s add a dynamic touch wrapper to it. we’re going to
    allow customers to access a Help Screen that will be a vertical
    list. We’ll also make each item on this help screen touchable.

2.  For extra credit - you can also add a new help screen that uses a
    sequence with touch wrappers.
