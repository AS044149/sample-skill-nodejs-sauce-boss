Here’s the storyboard our designer left with us. We can see exactly what
the visual component of a particular interaction should look like.
Notice how each of the four panels shows viewports for two types of
displays, the small round hub display, or what the customer will see on
a device with a form factor like the Echo Dot, and below it the large
Hub display, or what the customer will see on devices with a form factor
like the Echo Show. It’s good practice to start designing from the
smallest form factor and expanding outwards.

In this activity, we’ll be creating the visual component of the launch
request. After a customer invokes Sauce Boss by saying "Alexa, open
Sauce Boss" they should be presented with a welcome message and some
options. We can see exactly this interaction in the second panel.
