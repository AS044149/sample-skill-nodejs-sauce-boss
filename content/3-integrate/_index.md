# Add Visuals to Sauce Boss with an APL Document

In the first activity we created the Sauce Boss skill. While testing
your skill in the simluator, you may have noticed your skill is lacking
its screens. Sauce Boss Inc. is relying on us to add the visuals to the
skill. Let’s start by creating the screen for the LaunchRequest, which
displays when the customer says, "Alexa, open sauce boss." To do that,
we’ll create an APL Document and send it as a Directive to the Alexa
Service from our Skill’s back-end service.
