# Make the visuals dynamic with databinding

If a customer asks for a particular recipe from sauce boss, we need to
be able to find that recipe and recite it back to the customer. We
should also be able to display the recipe with a visual cue on the
screen. We can take a look at our storyboard for an idea of what the APL
Document needs to look like on both the small round hub viewport as well
as the large hub viewport.

After completing this activity, the skill will have a screen that shows
recipes dynamically and works with many viewports.
